TO DO:
    - Measure waiting time in the server side to isolate it from the client Hz
    - Each handler dumps the number of successfuk updates
    - Make the stressers work until all requests have been attended?
        - When there are many nodes working, only a couple of requests are attended during the operation time
        - Instead of providing operation time, we can provide number os successful updates as a condition to stop
